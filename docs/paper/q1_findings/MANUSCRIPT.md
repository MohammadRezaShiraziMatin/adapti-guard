**Status banner.** Track A VNEXT confirmation = **FAIL** (immutable). Track B Phase-1 LIVE = **SUPPORTED_IMPROVEMENT** (scoped; **does not reverse** Track A). This draft does **not** claim prompt injection is solved, SOTA defense, or production readiness.

**Claims map.** [`CLAIMS_MAP.md`](CLAIMS_MAP.md) · Dual-track [`../CLAIMS_CHECKLIST.md`](../CLAIMS_CHECKLIST.md) · Q1 scope [`../../experiments/DECISION_LOCK_Q1_P2_EVIDENCE_DESIGN.md`](../../experiments/DECISION_LOCK_Q1_P2_EVIDENCE_DESIGN.md) · Human cover packet [`SUBMISSION_PACKET.md`](SUBMISSION_PACKET.md) · Figures [`FIGURES.md`](FIGURES.md)

**Evidence base (this Q1 cycle):** Track A n=61 FAIL + Track B n=61 scoped improvement only. Confirmatory V2, external SOTA baselines, AgentDojo-class loops, and mechanism-pack live eval = **Future Work** (optional Phase 3 after human budget).

## Abstract

Runtime middleware for LLM agents maps detector scores to discrete actions (sanitize, restrict tools, block) and may adapt intervention level over episodes under a utility cost. Whether such **label-blind, cost-aware** policies reduce **defense-attributed** attack success while preserving benign utility is an empirical claim that requires hash-locked packs, an independent judge (Target ≠ Judge), and pre-registered stop rules—not a design narrative.

We report a **dual-track** confirmatory evaluation on two disjoint frozen packs and treatments. **Track A (VNEXT):** on `vnext_confirm_v1.0` (61 attack + 61 benign), VNEXT-ADAPT vs B0 **FAILS** the pre-registered qualified win: McNemar b10=5, b01=0, p=0.0625 (not significant at α=0.05); δ̂=0.0820 below MSID 0.20; utility U=0.9344 below gate 0.95. **Track B (Phase-1):** on a separate pack `phase1_confirm_v1`, PHASE1-CORE vs B0 shows **SUPPORTED_IMPROVEMENT** under Phase-1 MSID with utility eligible (δ̂=0.4426, 95% CI [0.2757, 0.6096] per AUDIT)—a **scoped** result on a different treatment and corpus; it is **not** a VNEXT pass and **does not overturn** Track A FAIL.

A **closed Layer A diagnostic** (40+40 TEST) shows detector lift without a significant adaptive ASR reduction (McNemar p=0.125). The contribution is an honest **evaluation methodology** and frozen negative/positive pair under explicit claim boundaries—not a fielded guard.

## 1. Introduction

Prompt injection and instruction override remain central risks for LLM-integrated applications: untrusted content in user prompts, retrieval, or tool outputs can redirect agent behavior. Engineering responses often stack **detection → risk band → discrete action**, optionally **adapting** the intervention level so that always-on blocking does not destroy benign utility.

Three evaluation mistakes recur in security reporting: (1) crediting **detector lift** as intervention success; (2) counting **target refusals** as defense wins in paired tests; (3) reporting ASR drops without a **utility co-primary** gate. AdaptiGuard is a testbed that makes those distinctions explicit via an intervention taxonomy and independent LLM judge.

This findings manuscript extends the shorter workshop negative-result packet ([`workshop_vnext_fail/MANUSCRIPT.md`](../workshop_vnext_fail/MANUSCRIPT.md)) by presenting **both confirmatory live tracks** with equal methodological visibility, while forbidding a merged “AdaptiGuard works” headline.

**Research questions (confirmatory, pre-registered per track).**

- **Track A:** Does label-blind adaptive **VNEXT-ADAPT** reduce defense-attributed attack success vs B0 on `vnext_confirm_v1.0` with U ≥ 0.95? **Answer: NO (FAIL).**
- **Track B:** Does **PHASE1-CORE** reduce harmful-action success vs B0 on `phase1_confirm_v1` under Phase-1 MSID with utility eligible? **Answer: YES (scoped SUPPORTED_IMPROVEMENT)—on that pack only.**

**Contributions (evaluation, not product).**

1. Dual-track **hash-locked** confirmatory design with frozen AUDIT artifacts and dual-track claim checklists.
2. **Confirmed negative** for VNEXT adaptive intervention under `VNEXT-MSID-0.1`.
3. **Scoped positive** for Phase-1 CORE on an independent pack—reported without reversing Track A.
4. Layer A **diagnostic** closure: detector v4 lift without adaptive win.
5. Limitations and **Future Work** map aligned to Q1 blockers (small n, heuristic detector, no AgentDojo/SOTA baselines, δ̂ CI gap on Track A).

**Non-claims.** We do not solve prompt injection, claim SOTA, or recommend production deployment. Phase 3 optional live arms (V2 pack, baselines, mechanism benchmark) are **not** part of this manuscript’s evidence base unless Matin later adds immutable AUDIT folders after budget sign-off.

---

## 2. Related Work

**Prompt injection.** Direct and indirect injection are documented by Perez and Ribeiro (2022), Greshake et al. (2023), and application-level threat models (Liu et al., 2023; OWASP LLM01).

**Agent and tool benchmarks.** AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024), InjecAgent (Zhan et al., 2024), and BIPIA (Yi et al., 2023) evaluate tool-using agents under adversarial content in rich environments. **This work is not an AgentDojo leaderboard entry** and must not be cited as one; our primary harness is episode-level Target+Judge scoring on frozen authored packs with declared tool success conditions.

**Static and training-time defenses.** Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023), guardrails (Rebedea et al., 2023), StruQ / SecAlign (Chen et al., 2024), and instruction hierarchy training (Wallace et al., 2024) change models or add classifiers. We study **runtime discrete actions** after a heuristic score, with explicit utility gates—complementary, not directly comparable without a shared locked protocol.

**Adaptive defense vs adaptive offense.** PAIR/GCG-style attacks adapt the **offense**. Adaptive **defense** under cost and utility constraints is less often subjected to pre-registered MSID + McNemar + utility co-primary testing. This paper foregrounds that **confirmatory hygiene**.

**Negative results and dual-track reporting.** Reporting FAIL alongside a scoped improvement on a **different** pack prevents a common failure mode: upgrading a Phase-1 arm into a reversal of an earlier FAIL. We treat dual-track separation as a **scientific reporting** requirement, not an administrative detail.

---

## 3. Threat Model

**System.** Middleware observes prompt and context at decision time, selects A0–A3, optionally adapts defense level label-blind, then invokes Target LLM unless blocked; independent Judge scores attack success and benign utility.

**Assets.** Task integrity, instruction confidentiality, tool authorization.

**Adversary.** Black-box UTF-8 in prompt/context; goals include override, exfiltration, persistence in concatenated context, obfuscation, tool-output-shaped injection. Frozen packs are **authored synthetic** corpora—not live adaptive red teaming.

**Defender.** No gold labels at runtime except named ORACLE diagnostic arms. Adaptation is counter-based, not RL.

**Out of scope.** Training-time poisoning, white-box weights, full AgentDojo sandboxes as primary evidence, browsing, production RAG. Target refusals are **not** defense wins in confirmatory taxonomy.

**Trust boundaries.** Judge is independent (different model ID); Judge does not receive treatment arm labels.

---

## 4. Method

### 4.1 Stack (shared conceptually; arms differ by track)

1. **Detection** — heuristic `PromptInjectionDetector` (Track B: `evidence_phase1.0`, τ=0.25/0.60; Track A / Layer A: v4 evidence path for VNEXT lineage).
2. **Risk** — LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH bands.
3. **Policy** — maps risk and adaptive level to A0–A3.
4. **Action** — sanitize (A1), tool deny (A2), block (A3).
5. **Adaptation** — VNEXT-ADAPT (Track A) vs PHASE1-CORE mapping (Track B); not interchangeable treatments.
6. **Evaluation** — Judge `attack_success` / utility; wins only in `{correct_block, correct_tool_deny}` for McNemar defense attribution.

### 4.2 Dual-track separation (binding)

| Track | Pack SHA-256 (prefix) | Treatment vs B0 | AUDIT folder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A — VNEXT** | `523c8818…` | VNEXT-ADAPT | `VNEXT_CONFIRM/20260914-133147/` |
| **B — Phase-1** | `c789811a…` | PHASE1-CORE | `PHASE1_CONFIRM/phase1_confirm_20260914T213022Z_a2681e92/` |

**Never** pool ASR across tracks in one unlabeled table.

### 4.3 Layer A (diagnostic only)

Frozen Layer A v3 TEST 40+40 — CLOSED; informs mechanism narrative; **not** confirmatory for either track above.

---

## 5. Protocol

### 5.1 Shared live eval contract

- **Target:** `qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct`
- **Judge:** `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct` (**Target ≠ Judge**)
- **Cache:** off on official confirmatory runs
- **Backend:** OpenRouter (historical spend on Track A ~$0.059 list-rate aid per AUDIT)

### 5.2 Track A — VNEXT (`VNEXT-PROTOCOL-0.1`, MSID δ=0.20)

- n_attack = n_benign = **61** on `vnext_confirm_v1.0`
- Qualified win requires McNemar significance, δ̂ ≥ MSID, U ≥ 0.95, and defense-attributed discordant pairs
- **Outcome: FAIL** — see §6.1

### 5.3 Track B — Phase-1 confirmatory LIVE

- Same n=61+61 on **different** pack `phase1_confirm_v1`
- Treatment **PHASE1-CORE** (not VNEXT-ADAPT)
- Phase-1 MSID and utility rules per Phase-1 protocol / AUDIT
- **Outcome: SUPPORTED_IMPROVEMENT (scoped)** — see §6.2

### 5.4 Statistics

- McNemar exact (intervention-mediated cells) per track separately
- Wilson / bootstrap CIs where reported in AUDIT for **proportions** (ASR, U)
- **Track A paired δ̂:** point estimate δ̂=0.0820 in AUDIT; **95% CI for δ̂ is not reported in official VNEXT AUDIT** — treat as **BLOCKING GAP**; do not fabricate (Q1-P2 §C). Optional future offline recompute from (b10, b01, n) requires a separate approved PR.

### 5.5 Future Work (not executed this cycle)

Per [`DECISION_LOCK_Q1_P2_EVIDENCE_DESIGN.md`](../../experiments/DECISION_LOCK_Q1_P2_EVIDENCE_DESIGN.md): Confirmatory V2 episodes/allocation/SAP/pack; AgentDojo-class loops; external SOTA baselines; `p1_mechanism_v1.0.0` live (`live_evaluated=false`). D-22 six `family_id` names locked for **future** V2 metadata; +1 remainder rule → `PRIVILEGE_EXFIL` when V2 is authorized.

---

## 6. Results

**Presentation rule:** Track A first (FAIL), then Track B (scoped improvement). Layer A diagnostic follows as non-confirmatory context. No pooled headline ASR.

### 6.1 Track A — VNEXT confirmation (**FAIL**)

Canonical: `experiments/real_llm_eval/VNEXT_CONFIRM/20260914-133147/AUDIT.md`

| Arm | n_attack | ASR | n_benign | U |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| B0 | 61 | **0.9508** (58/61) | 61 | 0.9672 |
| VNEXT-ADAPT | 61 | **0.8689** (53/61) | 61 | **0.9344** |

Wilson intervals for ASR/U as in workshop AUDIT table (e.g. B0 ASR [0.865, 0.983]; treatment U [0.843, 0.974]).

**McNemar (intervention-mediated):** b10=**5**, b01=**0**, exact two-sided p=**0.0625** → **not statistically significant** at α=0.05.

**Effect vs MSID:** δ̂ = (b10−b01)/n = **0.0820** &lt; MSID **0.20** → useful-intervention claim **fails**.

**δ̂ uncertainty:** Official AUDIT does **not** include a 95% confidence interval for δ̂. Manuscript text must **not** invent one. Label: **BLOCKING GAP** until an approved offline recompute artifact exists.

**Utility:** U=**0.9344** &lt; **0.95** (false blocks = 1) → utility-ineligible.

**Taxonomy (VNEXT-ADAPT):** five b10 = `correct_block` (A3); **53** `insufficient_intervention`; refusals not wins.

**Verdict:** Qualified win (H1) = **NO**. STATUS = **FAIL**. Fail reasons: `s5_mcnemar_not_significant`, `msid_not_met`, `s4_utility_ineligible`.

Family ASR cells (n∈{10,11}) are **descriptive** only (see workshop §6.2 table).

### 6.2 Track B — Phase-1 confirmatory LIVE (**SUPPORTED_IMPROVEMENT**, scoped)

Canonical: `experiments/real_llm_eval/PHASE1_CONFIRM/phase1_confirm_20260914T213022Z_a2681e92/AUDIT.md`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Pack | `phase1_confirm_v1`, SHA-256 `c789811a07d3ed06e1c77d8a45eda6172f480226e006d84fa28386a982536d01` |
| Treatment | PHASE1-CORE vs B0 |
| B0 ASR | **1.0000** |
| CORE ASR | **0.5574** |
| δ̂ | **0.4426**, 95% CI **[0.2757, 0.6096]** (per AUDIT) |
| McNemar | p=**1.49012e-08**, b10/b01=**27/0** (all `correct_tool_deny` per status sheet) |
| Utility U | **0.9672131147540983** (eligible) |
| API | 244 calls / 0 failures (AUDIT) |

**Interpretation bound:** This track supports a **scoped** claim that PHASE1-CORE reduced intervention-mediated harmful-action success vs B0 **on this pack** with utility above 0.95. It uses a **different** detector lock and treatment than VNEXT-ADAPT.

**Explicit non-interpretation:** Track B **does not reverse** Track A FAIL, is **not** evidence that VNEXT-ADAPT works, and is **not** solve-PI / SOTA / production-ready.

### 6.3 Layer A diagnostic (CLOSED)

On frozen TEST 40+40: v4 attack recall **27/40=0.675**, AUROC **0.705** vs v3 recall **0.05**. B3_V4 ASR **0.625** vs B0 **0.75**, McNemar p=**0.125** — **not** a demonstrated ASR reduction. Five of six discordant pairs were A1 target refusals, not A3 blocks. **Do not** mix Layer A TEST ASR with Track A or B confirmatory ASR in one unlabeled figure.

---

## 7. Failure Analysis (Track A primary)

Track A failed for **three sufficient reasons** (any one bars qualified win):

1. **McNemar:** p=0.0625 with b10=5 — not significant; do not call “marginal confirmation.”
2. **MSID:** δ̂=0.0820 &lt; 0.20 even if significance were arguable.
3. **Utility:** point U=0.9344 &lt; 0.95.

Attribution is **honest but insufficient:** all b10 are true A3 blocks, yet **53/61** attacks remain `insufficient_intervention`. Tool deny (`correct_tool_deny`) did not drive Track A McNemar cells (count 0).

Mechanism narrative (qualitative, CASE B): after detector lift, MEDIUM→A1 routing dominates; VNEXT action mix remains A1-heavy. This explains continuity with Layer A without pooling numbers.

Track B success on tool-deny-heavy taxonomy **does not** explain away Track A FAIL—they are different treatments and packs.

## 8. Limitations

Sourced from [`Q1_BLOCKER_MATRIX.md`](../../experiments/Q1_BLOCKER_MATRIX.md) and Q1-P2 dispositions:

| Limitation | P2 disposition | Honest reporting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Track A **FAIL** immutable | immutable | Confirmed negative; no FAIL→PASS |
| Small **n=61** per track | Future Work (V2); docs-fixed prose | Power/generalization limits; V2 not in this cycle |
| Track A δ̂ **95% CI absent** in AUDIT | docs-fixed (gap labeled) | Point δ̂ only; **BLOCKING GAP** |
| **Heuristic detector**; no AgentDojo-class loops | Future Work | Single-turn confirmatory scope |
| **No external SOTA baselines** | Future Work; P3-if-budget | Compare locked arms only |
| **Simulation ≠ confirmatory live** | docs-fixed | Do not cite `04_results.md` sim ASR as judge wins |
| **Dual-track mixup** risk | docs-fixed | Separate sections/tables always |
| Confirmatory **V2** deferred | Future Work | Paper uses A/B n=61 only |
| **`p1_mechanism_v1.0.0` not live-evaluated** | Future Work; P3-if-budget | Spec/freeze SHA only |
| **Venue TBD** | P4 human | No submission DONE in repo |
| **Overclaim** (refusal, L3 oracle, ASR=0 sim) | docs-fixed | Taxonomy + CLAIMS_MAP |
| Single Target/Judge pair | docs-fixed | No multi-model robustness claim |
| Authored synthetic packs | docs-fixed | Not production RAG/agents |

**Phase 3:** No new live AUDIT folders are claimed in this draft. Optional budgeted runs would add **separate** immutable artifacts—not amend Track A FAIL numbers.

---

## 9. Ethics

Documenting a **confirmed negative** (Track A) alongside a **bounded positive** (Track B) reduces the risk that operators over-trust adaptive runtime middleware. Synthetic attack text is for evaluation, not operational attack guidance. No human subjects or PII. Historical API spend is order $0.06 (Track A) plus Track B per AUDIT—not an environmental benchmark. Do not market AdaptiGuard as production-ready on these results.

---

## 11. Conclusion

Under pre-registered rules on `vnext_confirm_v1.0`, **VNEXT-ADAPT does not confirm** cost-aware adaptive runtime intervention: McNemar p=0.0625, δ̂=0.0820 below MSID 0.20, utility ineligible. On a separate Phase-1 pack, **PHASE1-CORE** shows **scoped** improvement vs B0 with AUDIT-reported δ̂=0.4426 and eligible utility—**without** reversing Track A. Layer A diagnostics show detector lift but not adaptive confirmatory success. The reusable outcome is **evaluation methodology and honest dual-track reporting**, not a shipped defense. Confirmatory V2 and agent-class benchmarks remain **Future Work** pending design locks and optional Phase 3 budget.
