# Q1 findings manuscript (dual-track)

**Purpose:** Findings-length English manuscript for the **Q1 / dual-track ladder** — broader than the short [`workshop_vnext_fail`](../workshop_vnext_fail/README.md) negative-result packet, but bound by the same frozen AUDIT numbers and [`DECISION_LOCK_Q1_P2_EVIDENCE_DESIGN.md`](../../experiments/DECISION_LOCK_Q1_P2_EVIDENCE_DESIGN.md).

**Author:** Seyed Mohammadreza Shirazi Matin · `mrshirazimatin@gmail.com`

**Mode:** Documentation draft only. **API=0.** Agents do **not** merge, upload to a venue, or run live LLM eval.

## Claim ceiling (this cycle)

| Supports | Does not support |
| --- | --- |
| Dual-track evaluation methodology (hash-locked packs, Target ≠ Judge, utility gates) | Solve prompt injection, SOTA, production-ready, FAIL→PASS |
| Track A **FAIL** — confirmed negative for VNEXT-ADAPT under pre-registered MSID | One unlabeled table mixing Track A ASR with Track B harmful-action rates |
| Track B **SUPPORTED_IMPROVEMENT** (scoped) on a **different** pack/treatment | Track B reversing Track A; VNEXT “works” |
| Layer A **CLOSED diagnostic** (detector lift; adaptive not significant) | Simulation / L3 oracle ASR=0 as live confirmatory wins |
| Confirmatory V2, AgentDojo loops, external baselines, mechanism live | **Future Work** per Q1-P2 (optional P3 after budget) |

**No Q1 acceptance guarantee.** Venue **TBD**. Submit = **HUMAN_ONLY**.
